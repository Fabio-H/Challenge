# Challenge
I have created this repository to practice my studies about programming in python.

In order to challenge myself, i've asked ChatGpt to generate some challenges to flex my knownledge, here it is:

1. **Simple Calculator:**
   Create a program that asks the user for two numbers and performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Temperature Converter:**
   Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. The conversion formulas are:
   - Celsius to Fahrenheit: \( F = \frac{9}{5} \times C + 32 \)
   - Fahrenheit to Celsius: \( C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32) \)

3. **Prime Number Checker:**
   Create a function that takes a number and checks if it is prime or not. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

4. **Guessing Game:**
   Implement a game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number. The program should provide hints if the number guessed by the player is higher or lower than the secret number.

5. **Word Counter:**
   Write a program that counts the number of words in a string provided by the user. Assume that words are separated by whitespace.

6. **Random Password Generator:**
   Create a program that generates a random password for the user. The password should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Tip: use the `random` module to generate random values.

7. **List Sorter:** 
   Implement a simple sorting algorithm such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort to sort a list of numbers provided by the user.

8. **Factorial Calculator:**
   Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number \( n \) is given by \( n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 1 \).

9. **Palindrome Validator:**
   Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, disregarding spaces and case sensitivity.

10. **Number Base Converter:**
    Implement functions that convert numbers between different numeral systems, such as decimal to binary, decimal to hexadecimal, etc.
